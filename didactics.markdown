# Didactics

Over the years, I've been creating several resources for teaching and learning purposes in the fields of computer science and machine learning.

## Machine learning courses

The home page for the projects:

* [UNIBO-81940](didactics/81940.markdown) (2023 edition) part of **Artifical Intelligence** course of the Master Degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna.

A set of `Python` notebooks for the course:

* [Linear regression with gradient descent](didactics/81940/src/linear-regression-w-gradient-descent.ipynb)
* [The neural network](didactics/81940/src/nn-rulez.ipynb)
* [The perceptron](didactics/81940/src/percettrone.ipynb)
* [Pytorch basics tutorial](didactics/81940/src/pytorch-tutorial.ipynb)
