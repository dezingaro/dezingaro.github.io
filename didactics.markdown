# Didactics

Over the years, I've been creating several resources for teaching and learning purposes in the fields of computer science and machine learning.

## 81940 - Artificial Intelligence courses

I am the academic tutor of the course **Artificial Intelligence** (81940) of the Master Degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna.

The home page for the projects:
