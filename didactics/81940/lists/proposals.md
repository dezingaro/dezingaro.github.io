## Edu_I

The project aims to exploit data from the academic career of a freshman student involved at University of Bologna in order to predict the **risk of dropping out** of university.

### Resources

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

* [Student Dropout Prediction](../assets/delbonifro2020.pdf)
* [Predictive models for effective policy making against university dropout](../assets/zingaro2020.pdf)

## Edu_II

The project aims to exploit data from the INVALSI test (primary and secondary school) to predict **low achievement** for a specific subject (Math, Italian or English) at the end of secondary school.

### Resources

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

* [Informing predictive models against Students Dropout](../assets/zanellati2022a.pdf)
* [Student Low Achievement Prediction](../assets/zanellati2022b.pdf)

## Med_I

The project aims to exploit **video data** from medical history of a patient developed with Bologna's IOR (Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli) to predict the quality score of the rehabilitation process.

## Med_II

The project aims to exploit **audio data** from the medical history of a patient to predict the risk of developing a specifi.

## VOO_I

The project aims to exploit data from the **chemical analysis of olive oil**-in collaboration with Carapelli Firenze S.p.A. and the University of Firenze-to predict the quality, geographical origin or cultival of a sample olive oil.

### Resources

A list of papers that can be used as a starting point for the project:

* [Authentication of the geographical origin of virgin olive oils from the main worldwide producing countries: A new combination of HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds and chemometrics applied to 1217 samples](../assets/cecchi(2020).pdf)
